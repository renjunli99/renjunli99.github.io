I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the University of HongKong, supervised by Luo Ping. I obtained my Master and B.Eng. degree at Tsinghua University.

I am currently intern at Shanghai AI Lab, supervised by Dr. Jiangmiao Pang.

My current research focus on perceptive legged locomotion and reinforcement learning.
